# neural_network_from_scratch
# Problem statement
The issuse we will be solving will be on digit classification. 

we will be using the MINST dataset (the classical example). these are 28x28 low res-grey scale images of hand written digits. 

we are going to build a neural network that is able to classify these digits. "so low end computer vision"

we are going to be developing a simple neural network that has 784 neurons (node) in the zeroth layer. Our frist (hidden) layer (with paramaters) will be the hidden layer with of 10 neurons (units) and second layer will be the output layer consisting of 10 neurons (units). each corrispondind to one unit that can be predictec from 0 to 9. 

# trining.

the first part of the training, we will be doing Forward propagation. (you take an image and you run it through the network from this network you compute what your output is going to be)
